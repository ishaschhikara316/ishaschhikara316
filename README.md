## $ cat isha.log

```
[init]  Born curious. Still running.
[msc]   Thesis: Can CRISPR reach tumour cells through scar tissue?
        → Short answer: it's complicated. Good research often is.
[drdo]  Sent rats to simulated altitude. Measured what stress does
        to a liver at 4,500m. Loved every chaotic moment of it.
[iitm]  Designed hepatic scaffolds. Learned that tissue engineering
        is 50% biology and 50% patience.
[code]  One day asked: what if the genes that help Tibetans survive
        mountains also help tumours survive hypoxia?
        → Nobody had checked. So I started checking.
[now]   Kaplan-Meier curves. DEA pipelines. TCGA data.
        Same questions. Different tools.

## 🔬 The Thread That Runs Through Everything

<div align="center">

```
        🏔️ altitude                    🧬 hepatocellular carcinoma
       hypoxia                              tumour hypoxia
      oxidative stress         ←──?──→      HIF1A signalling
     adaptation genes                       survival outcomes
```

*One organism adapts to low oxygen over millennia.*
*A tumour adapts to low oxygen over weeks.*
*What do they share? That's the question I keep returning to.*

## 🧪 Things I've Actually Done

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Ran survival analysis on 372 liver cancer patients**
Built a Python pipeline from scratch. Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression, hazard ratios. Found that HIF1A overexpression changes your odds — not gently.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Found a target hiding in plain sight**
DEA on 115 HCC patient samples. CD133 (PROM1) lit up in every tumour vs normal comparison. A druggable surface target that keeps getting overlooked.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Optimised assays at odd hours**
DIPAS, DRDO. MDA oxidative stress assays. Blood gas analysis. VO₂ max. Dissected rat livers, hearts, lungs. The kind of wet lab work that teaches you what biology actually feels like.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Asked if CRISPR can reach past scar tissue**
MSc thesis. The answer: the bottleneck isn't the editing — it's getting there. Fibrotic microenvironments are the real wall. That insight came from months of reading and arguing with the data.

## 🛠️ How I Work

<div align="center">

| wet lab | &nbsp;&nbsp;↔&nbsp;&nbsp; | computational |
|---:|:---:|:---|
| MDA assays · Western blots | | Python · R · Jupyter |
| tissue dissection · in vivo models | | Pandas · Lifelines · Limma |
| assay optimisation · protein extraction | | TCGA · GEO · ggplot2 |
| blood gas · VO₂ max | | survival analysis · DEA |

*I move between these without feeling like I've changed labs.*
*That turns out to be useful.*

## ✍️ I Also Write

Science that's hard to understand is science that goes nowhere.
So I write about anglerfish reproduction, liver regeneration, why apoptosis is kind of beautiful, and why we still can't cure the common cold — for anyone curious enough to read.
